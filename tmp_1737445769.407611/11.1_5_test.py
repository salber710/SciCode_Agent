# Background: In quantum mechanics, a ket vector such as |j‚ü© is a column vector that represents a state in a Hilbert space. 
# A standard basis vector in a d-dimensional space is a vector that has a 1 in the j-th position and 0 elsewhere, 
# where j is an index that ranges from 0 to d-1. When dealing with multiple subsystems, each possibly of different dimensions, 
# we use the tensor product to combine these states into a single state that represents the composite system. 
# This involves creating basis vectors in each subsystem's space and then taking their tensor product to form a state in the larger composite space.
