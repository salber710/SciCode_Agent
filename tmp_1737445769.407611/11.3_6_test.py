# Background: In quantum mechanics, a ket, denoted as |j⟩, is a vector in a complex vector space that represents the state of a quantum system. 
# When dealing with quantum systems of multiple particles or subsystems, the state is often represented as a tensor product of the states of 
# individual subsystems. In such scenarios, a standard basis vector in a d-dimensional space is a vector that has a 1 in the j-th position 
# and 0 elsewhere. If j is a list, the goal is to construct a larger vector space that is the tensor product of individual spaces specified 
# by dimensions in d. The tensor product combines the spaces into one larger space, and the corresponding ket represents a state in this 
# composite space.

# Background: In quantum computing, a bipartite maximally entangled state is a special quantum state involving two subsystems
# that are maximally correlated. A common example is the Bell state. In the context of $m$-rail encoding, each party's system
# is represented using multiple "rails" or qubits. The multi-rail encoding involves distributing the information across multiple
# qubits per party to potentially increase robustness against certain types of errors. The density matrix of such a state describes
# the statistical mixtures of quantum states that the system can be in. For a bipartite maximally entangled state with $m$-rail 
# encoding, the state is constructed in a larger Hilbert space, where each subsystem is represented by $m$ qubits.

# Background: In linear algebra and quantum mechanics, the tensor product (also known as the Kronecker product)
# is a fundamental operation that combines two or more matrices or vectors into a larger matrix. The tensor product
# of two matrices A and B, denoted A ⊗ B, results in a block matrix that contains all possible combinations of
# elements from A and B. This operation is crucial in quantum computing for representing the combined state
# of multiple quantum systems. The tensor product is associative and non-commutative, meaning the order in which
# the matrices are combined matters. Specifically, for vectors, the tensor product results in a higher-dimensional
# vector space, which is essential for representing multi-partite quantum states.
