# Background: The second order derivative of a function can be approximated using finite difference methods. 
# The central difference scheme is a popular method for this purpose due to its balance between accuracy and computational cost.
# For a second order accurate central difference scheme, the second derivative at a point can be approximated using the values of the function at neighboring points.
# The formula for the second derivative using a central difference scheme is:
# f''(x) â‰ˆ (f(x+dx) - 2*f(x) + f(x-dx)) / (dx^2)
# In this implementation, we use ghost cells to handle boundary conditions. Ghost cells are extra cells added to the computational domain to simplify the handling of boundary conditions.
# Here, the ghost cells are set to have the same value as the nearest boundary cell, which is a simple form of boundary condition.
