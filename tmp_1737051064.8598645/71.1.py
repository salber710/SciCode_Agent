# Background: In quantum mechanics, a ket vector |j‚ü© in a d-dimensional space is a column vector with a 1 in the j-th position and 0s elsewhere. 
# This is a standard basis vector in the context of quantum states. When dealing with multiple quantum systems, the tensor product of individual 
# kets is used to represent the combined state. The tensor product of vectors is a way to construct a new vector space from two or more vector spaces. 
# If j is a list, it represents multiple indices for which we need to create a tensor product of basis vectors. Similarly, if d is a list, it 
# represents the dimensions of each corresponding basis vector.
