# Background: In computational simulations, especially those involving particles in a confined space, it is common to use periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). 
# PBCs are used to simulate an infinite system by wrapping particles that move out of one side of the simulation box back into the opposite side. 
# This is particularly useful in molecular dynamics simulations to avoid edge effects and to mimic a bulk environment. 
# The idea is to ensure that any coordinate that exceeds the boundaries of the box is wrapped back into the box. 
# For a cubic box of size L, if a coordinate x is less than 0, it should be wrapped to x + L, and if it is greater than or equal to L, it should be wrapped to x - L. 
# This can be efficiently achieved using the modulo operation.


def wrap(r, L):
    '''Apply periodic boundary conditions to a vector of coordinates r for a cubic box of size L.
    Parameters:
    r : The (x, y, z) coordinates of a particle.
    L (float): The length of each side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    coord: numpy 1d array of floats, the wrapped coordinates such that they lie within the cubic box.
    '''
    # Use numpy's modulo operation to wrap the coordinates
    coord = np.mod(r, L)

# Background: In molecular simulations with periodic boundary conditions, the minimum image convention is used to calculate the shortest distance between two particles. 
# This is crucial for accurately computing interactions in a periodic system. The minimum image distance is the smallest distance between two particles, considering that 
# each particle can be represented by an infinite number of periodic images. For a cubic box of size L, the minimum image distance between two coordinates r1 and r2 
# is calculated by considering the direct distance and the distances obtained by shifting one of the coordinates by Â±L in each dimension. 
# The minimum image distance ensures that the calculated distance is the shortest possible, which is essential for correctly modeling interactions in a periodic system.
