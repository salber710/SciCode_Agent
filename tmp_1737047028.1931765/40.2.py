# Background: The second order derivative of a function can be approximated using finite difference methods. 
# The central difference scheme is a popular method for this purpose due to its balance between accuracy and computational cost.
# For a second order accurate central difference scheme, the second derivative at a point can be approximated using the values of the function at neighboring points.
# The formula for the second derivative using a central difference scheme is:
# f''(x) â‰ˆ (f(x+dx) - 2*f(x) + f(x-dx)) / (dx^2)
# In this implementation, we use ghost cells to handle boundary conditions. Ghost cells are extra cells added to the computational domain to simplify the handling of boundary conditions.
# Here, the ghost cells are set to have the same value as the nearest boundary cell, which is a simple form of boundary condition.

# Background: Strang splitting is a numerical method used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that involve multiple processes, such as advection and diffusion. 
# It is a type of operator splitting method that allows for the separate treatment of different terms in the PDE. 
# The first order Strang splitting involves splitting the time evolution operator into two parts, typically representing different physical processes, and applying them sequentially over half time steps.
# For a diffusion equation, the Strang splitting can be applied by first evolving the system with the diffusion operator for half a time step, then applying any other operators (e.g., advection) for a full time step, and finally applying the diffusion operator again for another half time step.
# This method is particularly useful for problems where different processes can be computed more efficiently or accurately when treated separately.
