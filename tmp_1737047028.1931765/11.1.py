# Background: In quantum mechanics, a ket vector |j‚ü© in a d-dimensional space is a column vector with a 1 in the j-th position and 0s elsewhere. 
# This is known as a standard basis vector. When dealing with multiple quantum systems, the state of the combined system is represented by the 
# tensor product of the individual states. If j is a list, it represents multiple indices for which we need to create a tensor product of 
# standard basis vectors. If d is a list, it specifies the dimensions of each individual space for the tensor product.
