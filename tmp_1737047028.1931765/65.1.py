# Background: The tensor product, also known as the Kronecker product, is an operation on two matrices (or vectors) that results in a block matrix. 
# If A is an m x n matrix and B is a p x q matrix, their Kronecker product A âŠ— B is an mp x nq matrix. 
# The Kronecker product is a generalization of the outer product from vectors to matrices. 
# It is used in various fields such as quantum computing, signal processing, and the study of multi-linear algebra. 
# In this function, we aim to compute the tensor product of an arbitrary number of matrices or vectors.
