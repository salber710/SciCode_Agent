    # Background: In quantum mechanics, a ket, denoted as |j‚ü©, is a vector in a complex vector space that represents the state of a quantum system. 
    # When dealing with quantum systems of multiple particles or subsystems, the state is often represented as a tensor product of the states of 
    # individual subsystems. In such scenarios, a standard basis vector in a d-dimensional space is a vector that has a 1 in the j-th position 
    # and 0 elsewhere. If j is a list, the goal is to construct a larger vector space that is the tensor product of individual spaces specified 
    # by dimensions in d. The tensor product combines the spaces into one larger space, and the corresponding ket represents a state in this 
    # composite space.
