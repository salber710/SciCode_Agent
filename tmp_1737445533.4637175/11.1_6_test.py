    # Background: 
    # In quantum mechanics and linear algebra, a standard basis vector in a d-dimensional space is a vector with a 1 in a single position and 0s elsewhere. 
    # When dealing with multiple quantum systems, the overall state is described by the tensor product of individual states. 
    # If we have a list of indices [j_1, j_2, ..., j_n] and a dimension list [d_1, d_2, ..., d_n], the task is to construct the tensor product of the individual basis vectors.
    # Each basis vector |j_i‚ü© in a d_i-dimensional space is a vector with 1 at position j_i and 0 elsewhere.
    # The numpy library can efficiently handle tensor products and array manipulations required to construct these vectors.
