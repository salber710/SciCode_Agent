# Background: In quantum mechanics, a ket, denoted as |jâŸ©, is a vector in a complex vector space that represents the state of a quantum system. 
# When dealing with quantum systems of multiple particles or subsystems, the state is often represented as a tensor product of the states of 
# individual subsystems. In such scenarios, a standard basis vector in a d-dimensional space is a vector that has a 1 in the j-th position 
# and 0 elsewhere. If j is a list, the goal is to construct a larger vector space that is the tensor product of individual spaces specified 
# by dimensions in d. The tensor product combines the spaces into one larger space, and the corresponding ket represents a state in this 
# composite space.

# Background: In quantum information theory, a bipartite maximally entangled state is a state of two quantum systems such that each subsystem is maximally entangled with the other. A common example of such a state is the Bell state or EPR pair. In the context of quantum computing, multi-rail encoding is a method of encoding quantum information across multiple physical rails (qubits) to enhance robustness to certain types of errors. The density matrix representation of a quantum state is used to describe mixed states, but for a pure state like a bipartite entangled state, the density matrix is simply the outer product of the state vector with itself.
