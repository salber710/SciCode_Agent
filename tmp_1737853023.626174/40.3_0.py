# Background: The second order derivative of a function can be approximated using finite difference methods. 
# The central difference scheme is a popular method for this purpose due to its balance of accuracy and simplicity.
# For a second order accurate central difference scheme, the second derivative at a point can be approximated as:
# f''(x) â‰ˆ (f(x+dx) - 2*f(x) + f(x-dx)) / (dx^2)
# This formula uses the values of the function at the point of interest and its immediate neighbors.
# In computational domains with boundaries, ghost cells are often used to handle boundary conditions. 
# Here, ghost cells are assigned the value of the nearest boundary cell to maintain the domain size and apply the scheme uniformly.

# Background: Strang splitting is a numerical method used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by splitting the problem into simpler sub-problems that can be solved sequentially. 
# It is particularly useful for problems involving both advection and diffusion processes. The method involves splitting the time evolution operator into two or more parts, 
# each of which can be solved more easily. For a PDE involving diffusion, the Strang splitting method can be applied by first solving the diffusion part for half a time step, 
# then solving the advection part for a full time step, and finally solving the diffusion part again for half a time step. This approach helps in maintaining the accuracy and stability 
# of the numerical solution over time.

# Background: The diffusion-reaction equation is a type of partial differential equation (PDE) that models processes involving both diffusion and reaction. 
# The diffusion term describes the spread of a quantity (e.g., heat, concentration) over space, while the reaction term accounts for local changes due to chemical reactions or other processes.
# To solve this equation numerically, we can use a combination of spatial discretization and time-stepping methods. 
# The second order spatial differentiation operator provides a more accurate approximation of the spatial derivatives, which is crucial for capturing the diffusion process accurately.
# The Strang splitting scheme allows us to handle the diffusion and reaction processes separately, improving the stability and accuracy of the solution.
# The first order forward Euler method is a simple and explicit time-stepping scheme that updates the solution at each time step based on the current state.
