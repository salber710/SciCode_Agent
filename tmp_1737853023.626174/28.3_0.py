# Background: 
# A Gaussian beam is a type of electromagnetic wave whose electric field amplitude distribution follows a Gaussian function. 
# The beam is characterized by its waist (w0), which is the location where the beam is narrowest. 
# As the beam propagates, its width increases, and its amplitude decreases. 
# The propagation of a Gaussian beam can be analyzed using Fourier optics, where the beam is transformed into the frequency domain, 
# manipulated, and then transformed back into the spatial domain. 
# The Fourier transform allows us to analyze how the beam's spatial frequency components evolve over distance. 
# The propagation in the Fourier domain is often simplified using the angular spectrum method, which involves multiplying by a phase factor.
# The intensity distribution of the beam is the square of the absolute value of the field distribution.
