# Background: 
# A Gaussian beam is a type of electromagnetic wave whose electric field amplitude distribution follows a Gaussian function. 
# The beam is characterized by its waist (w0), which is the location where the beam is narrowest. 
# As the beam propagates, its width increases, and its amplitude decreases. 
# The propagation of a Gaussian beam can be analyzed using Fourier optics, where the beam is transformed into the frequency domain, 
# manipulated, and then transformed back into the spatial domain. 
# The Fourier transform allows us to analyze how the beam's spatial frequency components evolve over distance. 
# The propagation in the Fourier domain is often simplified using the angular spectrum method, which involves multiplying by a phase factor.
# The intensity distribution of the beam is the square of the absolute value of the field distribution.

# Background: 
# The propagation of a Gaussian beam through an optical system can be analyzed using the ABCD matrix method. 
# This method uses a 2x2 matrix to describe the effect of optical elements (like lenses) on the beam's parameters.
# The complex beam parameter q is defined as 1/q = 1/R - i * (wavelength / (Ï€ * w^2)), where R is the radius of curvature 
# of the beam's wavefront and w is the beam waist. The transformation of the beam parameter through an optical system 
# is given by q' = (A*q + B) / (C*q + D), where A, B, C, and D are elements of the ABCD matrix.
# The waist size w(z) at a distance z from the lens can be calculated from the imaginary part of the complex beam parameter q(z).
