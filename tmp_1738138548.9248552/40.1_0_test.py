# Background: The second order derivative of a function can be approximated using finite difference methods. 
# The central difference scheme is a popular method for this purpose due to its balance of accuracy and simplicity.
# For a second order accurate central difference scheme, the second derivative at a point can be approximated as:
# f''(x) â‰ˆ (f(x+dx) - 2*f(x) + f(x-dx)) / (dx^2)
# This formula assumes that the function values at x+dx and x-dx are available. In computational grids, 
# especially near boundaries, ghost cells are often used to handle boundary conditions. Here, ghost cells 
# are filled with values equal to the nearest boundary cell to maintain the grid size and apply the central 
# difference scheme uniformly across the domain.
