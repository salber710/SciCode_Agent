# Background: The tensor product, also known as the Kronecker product, is a mathematical operation that takes two matrices (or vectors) and produces a new matrix. 
# It is a fundamental operation in quantum mechanics and linear algebra, used to describe the combined state of two systems. 
# The tensor product of matrices A (of size m x n) and B (of size p x q) results in a matrix of size (m*p) x (n*q). 
# This operation is associative, meaning the order of operations does not affect the result, allowing us to extend it to an arbitrary number of matrices.
