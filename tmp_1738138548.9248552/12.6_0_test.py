# Background: In quantum mechanics, bound states are solutions to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation where the particle is confined to a finite region of space, typically due to a potential well. These states have discrete energy levels. When dealing with multiple bound states, it is often necessary to sort them by energy to understand their relative stability and properties. In this context, the energy of a bound state is the primary sorting criterion. However, when energies are very close or identical, the angular momentum quantum number (l) can be used as a secondary criterion to break ties. This is done by slightly adjusting the energy value by a small factor proportional to l, ensuring that states with lower angular momentum are prioritized when energies are nearly the same.

def sort_states(bound_states):
    '''Input
    bound_states: a list of bound states found by the find_bound_states function, each element is a tuple containing the angular momentum quantum number (int) and energy (float)
    Output
    sorted_states: a list that contains the sorted bound_states tuples according to the following rules: State with lower energy will be in front. If two states have the same energy, the one with smaller angular momentum quantum number will be in front.
    '''
    # Sort the bound states by energy first, and then by angular momentum quantum number
