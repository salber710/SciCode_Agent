# Background: In quantum mechanics, a ket |j‚ü© represents a column vector in a complex vector space, often used to describe quantum states. 
# A standard basis vector in a d-dimensional space is a vector with a 1 in the j-th position and 0s elsewhere. 
# The tensor product of vectors is a way to construct a new vector space from two or more vector spaces, 
# and it is used to describe the combined state of multiple quantum systems. 
# If j is a list, we need to construct the tensor product of the basis vectors for each j_i in the corresponding d_i-dimensional space.
