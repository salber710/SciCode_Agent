# Background: In quantum mechanics, bound states refer to the discrete energy levels of a particle confined to a potential well, such as an electron in an atom. The Schr√∂dinger equation describes these states, and finding them involves solving the equation for specific energy values where the wavefunction satisfies boundary conditions. The shooting method is a numerical technique used to find these energy levels by adjusting the energy until the wavefunction behaves correctly at the boundaries. The `brentq` method from SciPy is a root-finding algorithm that can be used to find the energy values where the wavefunction satisfies the boundary conditions, indicating a bound state.
