# Background: The Schr√∂dinger equation for a quantum harmonic oscillator can be solved numerically using the Numerov method. 
# This method is particularly useful for solving second-order differential equations of the form u''(x) = f(x)u(x). 
# The function f(x) is derived from the potential energy and the energy level of the system. 
# Once the wave function u(x) is obtained, it must be normalized to ensure that the total probability of finding the particle is 1. 
# Normalization is achieved using Simpson's rule, which is a numerical integration technique that provides an accurate estimate of the integral of a function.
