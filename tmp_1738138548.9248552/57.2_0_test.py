# Background: The Numerov method is a numerical technique used to solve second-order linear differential equations of the form u''(x) = f(x)u(x). 
# It is particularly useful for solving the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation in quantum mechanics. The method is based on a finite difference 
# approach that provides a stable and accurate solution by considering the function values at three consecutive points. The key idea is to 
# approximate the second derivative using a Taylor expansion and to incorporate the function f(x) into the update formula. The Numerov method 
# requires initial conditions, which are typically the value of the function and its derivative at a boundary. The method iteratively computes 
# the solution across a discretized domain using a specified step size.

    '''Given precomputed function f(x), solve the differential equation u''(x) = f(x)*u(x)

    Inputs:
    - f_in: input function f(x); a 1D array of float representing the function values at discretized points
    - u_b: the value of u at boundary; a float
    - up_b: the derivative of u at boundary; a float
    - step: step size; a float.
