# Background: 
# In optics, paraxial rays are those that make small angles with the optical axis of a lens system. 
# The paraxial approximation simplifies the analysis of optical systems by assuming that sin(θ) ≈ θ and tan(θ) ≈ θ for small angles θ.
# This approximation is useful for calculating the behavior of light rays in lens systems, particularly for determining the focal points and image positions.
# In a doublet lens system, which consists of two lenses, the curvature of each lens surface and the refractive indices of the lens materials affect how light is refracted.
# The goal is to calculate the horizontal position where paraxial rays intersect the optical axis after passing through the lens system.
# This involves using the lensmaker's equation and the refraction at each lens surface to determine the path of the rays.
# The position of the third lens is used as the origin for these calculations.
