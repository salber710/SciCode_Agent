# Background: The Numerov method is a numerical technique used to solve second-order linear differential equations of the form u''(r) = f(r)u(r). It is particularly useful for problems in quantum mechanics, such as solving the radial part of the Schrödinger equation. The method is based on a finite difference approach that provides a higher order of accuracy by incorporating terms from Taylor expansions. The key idea is to approximate the solution at a new point using known values at previous points, taking into account the function f(r) that modifies the potential in the differential equation. The method requires initial conditions, such as the value of the function and its derivative at the starting point, and a step size for discretization.

def Numerov(f_in, u_at_0, up_at_0, step):
    '''Given precomputed function f(r), solve the differential equation u''(r) = f(r)*u(r)
    using the Numerov method.
    Inputs:
    - f_in: input function f(r); a 1D array of float representing the function values at discretized points.
    - u_at_0: the value of u at r = 0; a float.
    - up_at_0: the derivative of u at r = 0; a float.
    - step: step size; a float.
    Output:
    - u: the integration results at each point in the radial grid; a 1D array of float.
