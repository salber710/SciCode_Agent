# Background: In quantum mechanics, the ground state energy of a particle in a 1D infinite square well is given by the formula:
# E = (h^2 * n^2) / (8 * m * L^2), where h is the Planck constant, n is the principal quantum number (n=1 for ground state),
# m is the effective mass of the particle, and L is the width of the well. The effective mass m can be calculated as m = m_r * m_e,
# where m_r is the relative effective mass and m_e is the free electron mass. The energy E can be related to the wavelength of a photon
# by the equation E = h * c / 位, where c is the speed of light and 位 is the wavelength. By equating these two expressions for E,
# we can solve for 位, the wavelength of the photon corresponding to the ground state energy.
