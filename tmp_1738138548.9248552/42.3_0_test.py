# Background: 
# The laser threshold current (I_th) is the minimum current required to achieve lasing in a semiconductor laser. 
# It is determined by the balance between the optical gain and the losses in the laser cavity. 
# The threshold current can be calculated using the injected current density (J_w), the quantum well number (n_w), 
# the cavity length (L), and the device width (w). The injected current density is related to the gain coefficient 
# and empirical parameters. The threshold current is given by the product of the injected current density, 
# the area of the active region (which is the product of the cavity length, device width, and the number of quantum wells), 
# and the injection quantum efficiency (Î·).
