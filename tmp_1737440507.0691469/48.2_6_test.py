# Background: 
# In scattering experiments, understanding the momentum transfer is crucial. The momentum transfer vector Q is defined as 
# the difference between the scattered wave vector (k_s) and the incident wave vector (k_i). For an electron scattering 
# off a surface, the wave vectors can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface. The 
# in-plane momentum q is along the surface, while the out-of-plane momentum components k_i^z and k_s^z are perpendicular 
# to the surface. The angles th and gamma are used to determine these components. The energy of the electron is related 
# to its momentum by the de Broglie relation, where the wave vector magnitude |k| = sqrt(2mE) / Ä§. The calculations 
# require converting angles from degrees to radians and using trigonometric functions to find the components of k vectors 
# in the x and z directions. The constants given are the electron mass m_e in MeV/c^2 and Planck's constant hc in eV nm, 
# which will be used to compute the momenta in the chosen units.

# Background: In scattering experiments, the Coulomb matrix element describes the effective interaction 
# between charged particles, such as electrons, in reciprocal space. This is crucial for understanding 
# electron scattering processes. The effective Coulomb interaction, V_eff, at momentum \tilde{Q} = (q, \kappa) 
# is calculated using the in-plane momentum transfer q and the combined out-of-plane momentum \kappa = k_i^z + k_s^z. 
# In the cgs unit system and for simplification, we assume 4\pi*e^2 = 1, where e is the elementary charge. 
# The V_eff is thus determined by the inverse of the square magnitude of \tilde{Q}. The units for V_eff 
# are the inverse of square angstroms.
