# Background: 
# In quantum mechanics, the ground state energy of a particle in a 1D infinite square well is given by the formula:
# E_n = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2), where n is the principal quantum number (n=1 for ground state),
# h is the Planck constant, m is the particle's mass, and L is the width of the well.
# For an electron in a solid, we consider the effective mass, m_eff = m_r * m_e, where m_r is the relative effective mass
# and m_e is the free electron mass. The energy difference associated with this transition can be related to a photon
# wavelength 位 by the equation E = h * c / 位, where c is the speed of light.
# To find the wavelength corresponding to the ground state energy, we first calculate the energy using the modified
# mass and then use the energy-wavelength relationship to solve for 位.
