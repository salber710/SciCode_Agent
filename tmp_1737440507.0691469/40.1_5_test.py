# Background: 
# The second derivative of a function gives information about its concavity and inflection points. 
# In numerical analysis, the second derivative can be approximated using finite difference methods.
# The central difference scheme is a common method to approximate derivatives, offering a good balance 
# between accuracy and computational cost. For second-order accuracy, the central difference formula for 
# the second derivative at a point i is given by:
# f''(x_i) â‰ˆ (f(x_{i+1}) - 2*f(x_{i}) + f(x_{i-1})) / (dx^2)
# where dx is the spacing between points.
# For boundary conditions, ghost cells are used, where the value of a ghost cell is set equal to its 
# nearest boundary cell to maintain the same conditions at the edges, which helps in simplifying 
# calculations without additional boundary-specific logic.
