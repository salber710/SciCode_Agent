# Background: 
# In quantum mechanics, a ket vector |j‚ü© in a d-dimensional space is represented as a column vector 
# with all elements being zero except for the j-th position, which is 1. This is known as a standard 
# basis vector. When dealing with tensor products of basis vectors, the resulting vector is constructed 
# by taking the Kronecker product. If j is a list and d is an integer, each element j_i of j specifies 
# which basis vector to take in a d-dimensional space, and the tensor product of these vectors is computed.
# If d is also a list, each d_i specifies the dimension of the space for the corresponding j_i, and 
# the tensor product of these basis vectors across different dimensions is computed.
