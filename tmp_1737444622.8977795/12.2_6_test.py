# Background: 
# The Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. 
# For a central potential problem, such as the hydrogen atom, the radial part of the wave function satisfies a differential equation.
# When rewritten, the radial Schrödinger equation can be transformed into a form involving a radial function u(r), where
# u''(r) = f(r) * u(r). The potential involves a Coulomb potential term along with a kinetic term. In atomic units, these terms 
# simplify considerably. For hydrogen-like atoms with Z = 1, the potential term is -1/r. The kinetic term involves the second 
# derivative which is related to the angular momentum quantum number l. The function f(r) encapsulates these terms as:
# f(r) = 2 * (energy + 1/r) - l*(l+1)/r^2. This function f(r) is crucial for solving the radial Schrödinger equation using
# numerical methods.

# Background: The Numerov method is a numerical technique used to solve second-order linear differential equations 
# of the form u''(r) = f(r)u(r). This method is particularly effective for problems that involve smooth potentials 
# and is widely used in quantum mechanics for solving the Schrödinger equation. The key advantage of the Numerov 
# method is its ability to maintain high accuracy with relatively large step sizes. The formula for the Numerov 
# method involves using values of the function and its second derivative at three consecutive points to compute 
# the next value, which effectively incorporates information about the curvature of the function. Given initial 
# conditions u(0) and u'(0), along with the function f(r) and a step size, the Numerov method iteratively calculates 
# the wave function u(r) over a specified grid.
