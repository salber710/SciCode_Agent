# Background: 
# The Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. 
# For a central potential problem, such as the hydrogen atom, the radial part of the wave function satisfies a differential equation.
# When rewritten, the radial Schrödinger equation can be transformed into a form involving a radial function u(r), where
# u''(r) = f(r) * u(r). The potential involves a Coulomb potential term along with a kinetic term. In atomic units, these terms 
# simplify considerably. For hydrogen-like atoms with Z = 1, the potential term is -1/r. The kinetic term involves the second 
# derivative which is related to the angular momentum quantum number l. The function f(r) encapsulates these terms as:
# f(r) = 2 * (energy + 1/r) - l*(l+1)/r^2. This function f(r) is crucial for solving the radial Schrödinger equation using
# numerical methods.

    '''Input 
    energy: a float
    l: angular momentum quantum number; an int

# Background: The Numerov method is a numerical technique used to solve second-order linear differential equations of the form
# u''(r) = f(r)u(r). It is particularly useful for equations where the second derivative of u is expressed as a product of u and 
# a function f(r), as is the case with the radial part of the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen-like atoms. The method is 
# efficient and accurate for such problems because it incorporates information from multiple points in the discretized domain, 
# leading to higher-order accuracy. The method requires initial values of the function and its first derivative and uses a 
# recurrence relation to compute subsequent values. The recurrence relation for the Numerov method is given by:
# u_{n+1} = (2u_n(1 - 5h^2f_n/12) - u_{n-1}(1 + h^2f_{n-1}/12) + h^2f_{n+1}u_{n+1}/12) / (1 + h^2f_{n+1}/12),
# where h is the step size and f_n is the value of the function f(r) at the nth point.

# Background: To solve the Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen-like atom, we use the previously defined functions
# f_Schrod and Numerov to compute the radial wave function u(r). The function f_Schrod computes the effective potential
# f(r) from the Schrödinger equation, which is then used by the Numerov method to integrate and solve for u(r).
# Once we have the solution u(r), it is important to normalize it, ensuring the total probability is one. 
# Normalization involves integrating the square of the wave function over the radial domain. 
# Simpson's rule is an efficient numerical method for performing this integration due to its higher accuracy compared to 
# simpler methods like the trapezoidal rule. The integration must be done from the largest radius to simulate boundary 
# conditions effectively. The initial conditions are given by u_at_0 = 0 and up_at_0 = -1e-7, and the step size for 
# Numerov's method is determined by the difference between the first two points in the radial grid.
