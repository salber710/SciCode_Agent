# Background: The second order derivative of a function can be approximated using finite difference methods. 
# The central difference scheme is a popular method for this purpose due to its balance of accuracy and simplicity.
# For a second order accurate central difference scheme, the second derivative at a point can be approximated as:
# f''(x) â‰ˆ (f(x+dx) - 2*f(x) + f(x-dx)) / (dx^2)
# This formula uses the values of the function at the point of interest and its immediate neighbors.
# In computational domains with boundaries, ghost cells are often used to handle boundary conditions. 
# Here, ghost cells are assigned the value of the nearest boundary cell to maintain the domain size and apply the scheme uniformly.
