# Background: In quantum mechanics, a ket vector |j‚ü© in a d-dimensional space is a column vector with a 1 in the j-th position and 0s elsewhere. 
# This is a standard basis vector in the context of quantum states. When dealing with multiple quantum systems, the tensor product of individual 
# kets is used to represent the combined state. The tensor product of vectors results in a higher-dimensional vector space, where the dimensions 
# are the product of the individual dimensions. In this problem, we need to construct such a ket vector or a tensor product of multiple ket vectors 
# based on the input dimensions and indices.

# Background: In linear algebra and quantum mechanics, the tensor product (also known as the Kronecker product) is an operation on two matrices or vectors that results in a block matrix. For vectors, the tensor product results in a higher-dimensional vector. For matrices, it results in a larger matrix that combines the information of the input matrices. The tensor product is essential in quantum mechanics for describing the state of a composite quantum system. The Kronecker product of matrices A (of size m x n) and B (of size p x q) is a matrix of size (m*p) x (n*q).

# Background: In quantum mechanics, a quantum channel is a mathematical model for the physical process of transmitting quantum states. 
# The action of a quantum channel on a quantum state can be described using Kraus operators. The Kraus representation of a quantum channel 
# is given by the equation: ùí©(œÅ) = ‚àë_i K_i œÅ K_i^‚Ä†, where K_i are the Kraus operators and K_i^‚Ä† is the conjugate transpose of K_i. 
# The Kraus operators satisfy the completeness relation ‚àë_i K_i^‚Ä† K_i = I, where I is the identity operator. 
# When a quantum channel acts on a specific subsystem of a composite quantum state, the Kraus operators are applied to that subsystem, 
# while the identity operator acts on the other subsystems. This is achieved by taking the tensor product of the identity operators 
# and the Kraus operators, ensuring that the channel acts only on the specified subsystem.
