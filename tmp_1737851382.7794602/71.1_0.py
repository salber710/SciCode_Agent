# Background: In quantum mechanics, a ket vector |j‚ü© in a d-dimensional space is a column vector with a 1 in the j-th position and 0s elsewhere. 
# This is a standard basis vector in the context of quantum states. When dealing with multiple quantum systems, the tensor product of individual 
# kets is used to represent the combined state. The tensor product of vectors results in a higher-dimensional vector space, where the dimensions 
# are the product of the individual dimensions. In this problem, we need to construct such a ket vector or a tensor product of multiple ket vectors 
# based on the input dimensions and indices.
