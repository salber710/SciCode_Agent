# Background: The 2D heat equation is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time. In this problem, we are dealing with a grid that represents a physical space divided into two materials with different thermal properties. The thermal diffusivity is a material-specific property that indicates how quickly heat spreads through the material. The task is to initialize a 3D array to store temperature values over time and a 2D array to store thermal diffusivity values for each grid point. The grid is divided by a vertical interface, with different initial temperatures and thermal diffusivities on either side of the interface.

    '''Initialize a 3d array for storing the temperature values. The array has one time dimension and two real space dimensions.

# Background: Dirichlet boundary conditions are a type of boundary condition used in differential equations where the value of the function is specified on the boundary of the domain. In the context of the heat equation, this means setting the temperature at specific grid points to a fixed value. This is useful for simulating scenarios where the temperature at the boundary is controlled or known. When applying these conditions, it is important to avoid setting them at corner points to prevent over-constraining the system, which can lead to numerical instability or inaccuracies.

# Background: Neumann boundary conditions specify the derivative (gradient) of the function at the boundary rather than the function's value itself. 
# In the context of the heat equation, this means specifying the rate of change of temperature at the boundary, which can represent heat flux. 
# To implement Neumann boundary conditions numerically, we use finite difference methods. 
# For a boundary point, the forward difference method is used if the boundary is at the start of the grid, and the backward difference method is used if the boundary is at the end. 
# This ensures that the derivative is calculated in the direction pointing outward from the boundary. 
# Neumann conditions are not applied to corner points to avoid over-constraining the system.

# Background: The 2D heat equation can be solved numerically using the finite difference method. 
# This involves discretizing the spatial domain into a grid and updating the temperature at each grid point over time.

# The time increment is chosen based on the maximum thermal diffusivity to ensure numerical stability, specifically using 
# the condition Î”t = 1 / (4 * max(alpha1, alpha2)). Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are applied at each time step 
# to maintain the specified temperature values and gradients at the boundaries, respectively.
