# Background: The second order derivative of a function can be approximated using finite difference methods. 
# The central difference scheme is a popular method for this purpose due to its balance of accuracy and simplicity.
# For a second order accurate central difference scheme, the second derivative at a point can be approximated as:
# f''(x) â‰ˆ (f(x+dx) - 2*f(x) + f(x-dx)) / (dx^2)
# This formula uses the values of the function at the point of interest and its immediate neighbors.
# In computational domains with boundaries, ghost cells are often used to handle boundary conditions. 
# Here, ghost cells are assigned the value of the nearest boundary cell to maintain the domain size and apply the scheme uniformly.

# Background: Strang splitting is a numerical method used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by splitting the problem into simpler sub-problems that can be solved sequentially. 
# It is particularly useful for problems involving both advection and diffusion processes. The method involves splitting the time evolution operator into two or more parts, 
# each of which can be solved more easily. For a PDE involving diffusion, the Strang splitting method can be applied by first solving the diffusion part for half a time step, 
# then solving the advection part for a full time step, and finally solving the diffusion part again for half a time step. This approach helps in maintaining the accuracy and stability 
# of the numerical solution over time.
