# Background: The second-order derivative of a function can be approximated using a centered finite difference scheme. 
# This approach is often used in numerical methods to approximate derivatives when the exact form of the function is unknown 
# or difficult to differentiate analytically. The centered finite difference method uses values at surrounding points to 
# approximate the derivative at a point of interest. The second-order centered difference formula is given by:
# f''(x) â‰ˆ (f(x+dx) - 2*f(x) + f(x-dx)) / (dx^2),
# where dx is the spacing between points. To handle boundary conditions, ghost cells can be utilized, which extend the 
# grid beyond its physical boundaries. In this implementation, ghost cells are used with values equal to the nearest 
# cell on the boundary, which helps in maintaining the scheme's symmetry and accuracy at the boundaries.
