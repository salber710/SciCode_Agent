# Background: 
# To calculate the horizontal position of intersection of paraxial rays with the optical axis
# for a doublet lens, we use the principles of geometrical optics, particularly the lensmaker's
# equation and paraxial approximation. The paraxial approximation allows us to simplify the 
# trigonometric calculations by assuming small angles, where sin(θ) ≈ θ and tan(θ) ≈ θ.
# In a lens system, each surface can be treated with its own refraction using Snell's Law, and 
# the lensmaker's formula relates the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces to the focal length.
# The effective focal length and image position can be determined by considering the refraction 
# at each surface and the propagation through the lens.
# For paraxial rays, the height of the ray at each surface and the angle with the optical axis 
# are key parameters, and the position where a paraxial ray intersects the optical axis is 
# influenced by the curvature of the lenses and the refractive indices involved.
