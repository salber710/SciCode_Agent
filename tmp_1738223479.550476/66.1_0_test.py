# Background: Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice.
# The lattice has two distinct directions: the armchair direction and the zigzag direction. In this problem,
# the armchair direction is along the y-axis, and the zigzag direction is along the x-axis. The basic unit
# of the graphene lattice can be described using two lattice vectors. The lattice constant `a` defines the
# distance between adjacent carbon atoms along the zigzag direction. For graphene, the distance between
# nearest neighbors is typically 1.42 Ã…. The sliding distance `s` represents a shift of the entire lattice
# in the y-direction. This is used to simulate variations in the lattice position. The z-coordinate `z` is
# constant for all atoms in a monolayer graphene plane. The parameter `n` defines the number of repeating
# units (supercells) in both the positive and negative x and y directions from the origin.
