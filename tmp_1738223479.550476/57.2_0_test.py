# Background: The Numerov method is a numerical technique used to solve second-order linear differential equations of the form u''(x) = f(x)u(x). 
# This method is particularly useful for solving the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation in quantum mechanics. 
# It is a predictor-corrector method that provides higher accuracy by incorporating second-derivative information into the finite difference scheme. 
# The key idea is to express u(x) using a central difference approximation which involves the values of the function at multiple points.
# Specifically, the Numerov method updates the solution using the formula:
# u[i+1] = (2(1 - 5/12 * step^2 * f[i]) * u[i] - (1 + 1/12 * step^2 * f[i-1]) * u[i-1]) / (1 + 1/12 * step^2 * f[i+1])
# This requires initial conditions, such as the value of u and its derivative at a boundary point, to propagate the solution over a grid.
