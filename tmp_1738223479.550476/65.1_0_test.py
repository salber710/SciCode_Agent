# Background: The tensor product, also known as the Kronecker product, is an operation on two matrices of arbitrary size resulting in a block matrix. 
# If A is an m x n matrix and B is a p x q matrix, their Kronecker product A âŠ— B is an (m*p) x (n*q) matrix. 
# This operation is useful in quantum computing, where it describes the combined state space of two systems, and in various numerical methods and machine learning tasks.
