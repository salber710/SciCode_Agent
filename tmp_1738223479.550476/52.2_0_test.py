    l (int): The angular momentum quantum number.

# Background: The radial part of the Schr√∂dinger equation for hydrogen can be expressed as a system of linear differential equations. 
# We are dealing with a second-order differential equation that involves the wave function u(r) and its derivative. 
# The task is to integrate this system over a range of r values, using initial conditions. 
# Starting from a large value of r ensures that the boundary conditions are met for bound states. 
# Numerical integration will be performed using Simpson's rule to ensure accuracy in the normalization of the wave function.
