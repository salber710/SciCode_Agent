# Background: KL-divergence (Kullback-Leibler divergence) is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. 
# It is often used in information theory to quantify the difference between two probability distributions. 
# The formula for KL-divergence from a probability distribution p to a distribution q is:
# KL(p || q) = Î£ p(x) * log2(p(x) / q(x)) for all x where p(x) > 0.
# This function assumes that both p and q are probability distributions over the same support,
# meaning they both sum to 1 and have non-negative values.
