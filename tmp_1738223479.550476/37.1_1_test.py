    - d1 (float): Separation distance between first and second surfaces
    - d2 (float): Separation distance between second and third surfaces
    - n1 (float): Refractive index of the first lens material
    - n2 (float): Refractive index of the second lens material
    - n3 (float): Refractive index of the third lens material
