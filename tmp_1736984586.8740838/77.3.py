# Background: In computational simulations, especially those involving molecular dynamics or particle systems, it is common to use periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) to simulate an infinite system using a finite-sized simulation box. This approach helps to minimize edge effects and allows particles to move seamlessly across the boundaries of the simulation box. When a particle moves out of one side of the box, it re-enters from the opposite side. Mathematically, this is achieved by wrapping the particle's coordinates back into the box using the modulo operation. For a cubic box of size L, each coordinate of a particle is wrapped using the formula: wrapped_coordinate = coordinate % L. This ensures that all particle coordinates remain within the range [0, L).


def wrap(r, L):
    '''Apply periodic boundary conditions to a vector of coordinates r for a cubic box of size L.
    Parameters:
    r : The (x, y, z) coordinates of a particle.
    L (float): The length of each side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    coord: numpy 1d array of floats, the wrapped coordinates such that they lie within the cubic box.
    '''
    # Use numpy's modulo operation to wrap each coordinate within the range [0, L)
    coord = np.mod(r, L)
    return coord


# Background: In molecular simulations with periodic boundary conditions, the minimum image convention is used to calculate the shortest distance between two particles. This is crucial for accurately computing interactions in a periodic system. The minimum image distance is the smallest distance between two particles, considering that each particle can be represented by an infinite number of periodic images. For a cubic box of size L, the minimum image distance along each coordinate can be calculated by considering the displacement and adjusting it to be within the range [-L/2, L/2]. This ensures that the shortest path across the periodic boundaries is used.


def dist(r1, r2, L):
    '''Calculate the minimum image distance between two atoms in a periodic cubic system.
    Parameters:
    r1 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the first atom.
    r2 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the second atom.
    L (float): The length of the side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    float: The minimum image distance between the two atoms.
    '''
    # Calculate the displacement vector between the two atoms
    delta = np.array(r2) - np.array(r1)
    
    # Apply the minimum image convention
    delta = delta - L * np.round(delta / L)
    
    # Calculate the Euclidean distance using the adjusted displacement
    distance = np.linalg.norm(delta)
    
    return distance



# Background: In molecular simulations with periodic boundary conditions, it is often necessary to calculate not just the minimum image distance but also the minimum image vector between two particles. The minimum image vector is the vector that points from one particle to another, considering the periodic boundaries, and is adjusted to be the shortest possible vector. This is important for calculating forces and other vector quantities in a periodic system. For a cubic box of size L, the minimum image vector along each coordinate can be calculated by considering the displacement and adjusting it to be within the range [-L/2, L/2]. This ensures that the shortest path across the periodic boundaries is used.

    r2 : The (x, y, z) coordinates of the second atom.
    L (float): The length of the side of the cubic box.
    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: The minimum image vector between the two atoms.
