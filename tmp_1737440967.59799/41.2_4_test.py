# Background: 
# In a serial dilution system with multiple species and resources, each species consumes resources in a specific order of preference.
# The process involves calculating how each resource contributes to the growth of each species during a cycle.
# Growth is exponential and determined by specific growth rates for each resource-species pair.
# The conversion matrix M[i, j] indicates the biomass conversion from the i-th resource to the j-th species.
# Given the growth rates, species' preferences, temporal niches, and depletion order, we can calculate how much of each resource contributes to the growth of each species.
# The growth of a species on a resource is given by exp(growth_rate * time_in_niche), assuming a yield of 1.

# Background: In the context of ecological modeling, the structural stability of a community can be analyzed by examining the resource supply space, which is represented as a simplex. The simplex is defined by the constraint âˆ‘R_i = 1, where R_i denotes the fraction of resource i. The convex hull of points in this space that support stable coexistence of species is determined by the conversion matrix M. The matrix M represents how efficiently each resource is converted into biomass for each species. The task is to find the extreme points in this supply space, which can be thought of as the vertices of the convex hull, indicating the boundaries of conditions under which all species can coexist.
